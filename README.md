# Google Play Store App Ratings Prediction Project Document

## Project Overview
The Google Play Store App Ratings Prediction project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts the rating of apps on the Google Play Store. The project utilizes data on app features and user reviews to build a model that can predict the rating of an app.

## Objective & Business Scope
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the rating of apps on the Google Play Store. The model will be beneficial for app developers, marketers, and users to understand the factors that contribute to an app's rating and make informed decisions.

## Benefits for Users
- Provides accurate predictions of app ratings.
- Enables app developers and marketers to identify the factors that contribute to an app's rating and make informed decisions.
- Helps users make informed decisions when downloading and using apps.

## Narrative of Key Steps
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Model selection and evaluation
5. Model deployment

The project started with data collection and preprocessing, where data on app features and user reviews were collected and cleaned to remove inconsistencies and errors. Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data and identify patterns and trends.

Feature engineering was performed to create new features that could improve the model's accuracy. Machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, were trained and evaluated using the data. Hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize the models' performance.

The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, including mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared. Finally, the best-performing model was selected and deployed to a web application to enable users to input app features and receive predictions on the app's rating.

The web application was built using Flask, a Python web framework, and deployed on Heroku, making it accessible to the public. The project documentation includes a detailed description of the data sources, data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation metrics.
